# RLGL Type by Ernest Bruno
-----------
## Project Description
-----------
The project is a browser-based game that is similar to the TypeRacer game, but with a twist. The TypeRacer game is a game where a user is given a set of words (can be a phrase, or a section of an article and does not have to make sense at all.) and the user will have to type every character in every word correctly until they finish everything in one set. RLGLT (Red Light Green Light Type) does the same thing but with the Red Light Green Light functionality and health point system. For this case, the player is not allowed to type anything when the light is red and they will be enabled once the light is green. There will be an indicator somewhere on the screen that will notify the user if it’s safe to type or not. If the player types while the light is red, they lose one health point. At the same time, the player will only have 60 seconds to correctly type as many words as they can within that set. Game ends when one of the following scenarios are met: Hp to 0, time runs out. Or finish set. Time is of the essence, so they need to type away! When a game is finished, the game will display the player’s words per minute for that particular game / scenario, if the player won the game or not, and a button to reset the game.
